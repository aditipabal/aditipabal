## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on data analysis projects, focusing on machine learning and computational social science at UMass Amherst.
## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced data analytics, predictive modeling, and how technology shapes societal trends.
## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on machine learning models, data visualization projects, and social science research using data.
## ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with advanced statistical techniques and optimizing machine learning models.
## ðŸ’¬ Ask me about data science, social network analysis, programming in Python, or techâ€™s role in society.
## ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
## âš¡ Fun fact: I love exploring how data can explain human behavior and predict future trends.
